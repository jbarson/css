## CSS Box Model ⬜

- Every HTML element has a box around it 🔳

- Box-sizing property

## Layout with Floats🔁

- Float is a CSS positioning property
- Initially used to wrap text around images
- Floats was being used for web layouts
- Element can be floated left or right
- Since the flow is changed, elements are not part of the normal flow
- The parent element contained floated elements can collapsed

## Flexbox 💟

- A better way to layout elements

> The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) provides a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute **space** among **items** in a **container**, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.

- A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

- When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the **main axis** and the **cross axis**. The main axis is defined by the `flex-direction` property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.

## Understanding The Cascasde 💦

When 2 or more conflicting style rules target the same element, the browser has to decide which CSS styles to apply, iow which style will win! 🥇

### The Cascade (Simplified)

To determine the winning style, the browser will go through a cascade.

- 1️⃣ Selector Specificity - The more specific selector wins
- 2️⃣ Source Order - if the same specificity, the source order will matter

#### CSS Specificity

📏Specificity Rules

- The more specific selector gets applied
- A score is attributed to a selector

  - nb ids x 100 pts
  - nb classes x 10 pts
  - nb of elements x 1pt

* inline-style => 1000 pts

#### Source Order 🎢

- The last style overwrites any preceding conflicting rule that has the same specificity.
- It also depends on how the style was added

- 2️⃣Internal
